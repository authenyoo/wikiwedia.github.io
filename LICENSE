///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The Blahaj License aims to simply ensure the proper acknowledgment of my work!
This license prohibits trademark, patent, and commercial use. I do not assume 
liability or offer warranty for your use of this work. You are permitted to use
it privately and for educational settings and/or purposes. Modification,
distribution, and edits are allowed, provided the proper credit is given. Proper
credit could be an std::out/print of my github profile or name, or somewhere written
within the work, like a UI window, or a .txt file. You may also use the Blahaj license
for your own projects, given you modify it to fit your needs and credit me proper.

I'm not a lawyer, and I can't confirm the legal correctness of the Blahaj license,
but this serves as a warning and just some rules to follow with kindness in mind.
I can't sue or legally threaten you but I probably will not like you if you don't
follow this. :(
